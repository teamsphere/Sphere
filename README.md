### Motivation

_Many online learning platforms exist today spanning the breadth of human knowledge, so why bother with another? Being an avid user of different kinds of MOOCS and online courses for the past few years, I find that few are designed well for the student. Many appear to be created as though the act of learning something was an after-thought, and some are blatant money-grabs using recycled content that should be avoided at all costs. The idea for the project is based on the tree of Diderot and d'Alembert, which was a tree developed to represent the structure of knowledge itself, produced for the Encyclop√©die. If there could be a single place that all of the world's knowledge could be kept, maintained and added to in a visually coherent, well edited, and easy to use format for the modern learner, then the Sphere hopes to achieve it. You might be thinking, isn't there Wikipedia already? The goal is not to create a Wikipedia clone, but to extend what can be created by a community of contributors into neatly arranged topic and course formats. Once the project gets it's footing, the need for a platform of this nature will hopefully become apparent._
