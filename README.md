# An Open Source Learning Platform



### "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's mind there are few." ###
― Shunryu Suzuki



## Motivation

Many online learning platforms exist today spanning the breadth of human knowledge, so why bother with another? The problem starts with that few are designed well for the student. Many appear to be created as though the act of learning something was an after-thought. The Sphere hopes to combat that with a model of pairing expert topic contributors with wonderfully skilled content creators. 


The initial ideas were based on the tree of Diderot and d'Alembert, a tree developed to represent the structure of knowledge itself, produced for the Encyclopédie (produced 1751-72). If there were to be a single place that all of the world's knowledge could be kept, maintained and added to in a visually coherent, well edited, and easy to use format for the modern learner, then the Sphere hopes to achieve it.


You might be thinking, isn't there [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) already? The goal here is not to create a Wikipedia clone, but to extend the art of the possible by a global community of contributors into perfectly crafted course formats. The focus is on learning for the student, not an information store. This allows us the option of going experimental with learning methods and beautifully display content in new and interesting ways. It is incredibly important that a person connects with a topic they are interested in, and should be a prerequesite for learning.


Once the project gets going, we hope the need for a platform of this nature will become apparent.
